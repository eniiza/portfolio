    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm an aspiring Web Developer who loves building accessible, hand-coded, unique designs that break away from the sterile blue-n-white of the modern internet. I've been practicing and honing my skills since 2022, and I dream of the day I can branch out into the world and make meaningful designs for everyone to use.</p>
